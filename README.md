## PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Ken’s Supplies** seeks to deepen its understanding of sales performance across various product subcategories by analyzing key metrics such as sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold. The primary challenge is identifying year-over-year trends and evaluating the contribution of each subcategory to overall business performance. A lack of clear insight into these trends hinders effective decision-making related to inventory management, pricing strategies, and product investment. By thoroughly analyzing these metrics, Ken’s Supplies can uncover growth opportunities, address underperforming areas, and gain the insights necessary to optimize inventory, refine pricing strategies, and guide future investments in key product categories.
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Provide an overview of year over year sales performance, focusing on sales revenue, profit, and quantity.
- Analyze sales trends, identifying top performing and underperforming areas.
- Improve profitability and sales growth by understanding key performance metrics across product subcategories.
- Visualize sales metrics and trends using Tableau to present actionable insights to decision makers.
- Use insights to make recommendations for enhancing business profitability.

## SKILL & CONCEPT DEMOSTRATED
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding & Preparation
- Data import into Tableau
- Create calculated fields and bulid visualizations
- Design the dashboard layout

## MODELLING
I conducted comprehensive data cleaning by using filter functions to eliminate null values and ensuring proper formatting of each column (Date, Text, Number) to support accurate analysis.The data model consists of a main table, **Orders**, which includes fields such as (Row ID, Order ID, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Segment, Postal Code, Product ID, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit). Additionally, there are sub-tables for **Customers**, linking (customer names and IDs); **Location**, adding details like (postal code, city, state, region, and country) and **Products**, containing (product ID, category, subcategory, and product name). By integrating these tables, we can conduct comprehensive analyses to better understand sales performance at both the product and customer levels.
